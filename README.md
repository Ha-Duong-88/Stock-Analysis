# Stock-Analysis

# Overview of Project

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to refactor Microsoft Excel VBA code to collect total daily volume and return for 12 green energy stock prices for the years 2017 and 2018 and determine whether or not these stocks are worth investing in. The starting point was to reuse code that set up a similar structure. The goal of the challenge was to reuse and refactor the original code to perform the analysis for 2017 and 2018 stocks and improve the overall efficiency of the code.

## Data

The data used in this analysis were two separate worksheets for 2017 and 2018 stock information. The data contained therein included the ticker index, the stock issue date, the opening price, the high and low price, the adjusted closing price, and the volume for each stock. The objective of the analysis was to retrieve the ticker, the total daily volume, and the return on each stock.

The challenge instructions were to add code to determine the total daily volume and return for each stock for each year and refactor the code structure.

## Results

Before refactoring the code, I determined the code that I could reuse and copied the code to create the table headers,the input box for the year that I want to run the analysis, the ticker array, and to format the header rows and conditional color formatting. I also made sure that I activated the correct worksheet to output the data.

The instruction and code as written in the file are below.
